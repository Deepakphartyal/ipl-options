                   <h1>About IPL</h1>
                   <p>The Indian Premier League (IPL), also known as the TATA IPL for sponsorship reasons, is a men's Twenty20 (T20) cricket league held annually in India. Founded by the BCCI in 2007, the league features ten city-based franchise teams.[3][4] The IPL usually takes place during the summer, between March and May each year. It has an exclusive window in the ICC Future Tours Programme, resulting in fewer international cricket tours occurring during the IPL seasons.[5]

                    The IPL is the most popular cricket league in the world; in 2014, it ranked sixth in average attendance among all sports leagues.[6] In 2010, the IPL became the first sporting event to be broadcast live on YouTube.[7][8] Inspired by the success of the IPL, other Indian sports leagues have been established.[a][11][12][13] In 2022, the league's brand value was estimated at ₹90,038 crore (US$11 billion).[14] According to the BCCI, the 2015 IPL season contributed ₹1,150 crore (US$140 million) to India's GDP.[15] In December 2022, the IPL achieved a valuation of US$10.9 billion, becoming a decacorn and registering a 75% growth in dollar terms since 2020 when it was valued at $6.2 billion, according to a report by the consulting firm D and P Advisory.[16] Its 2023 final became the most streamed live event on the internet, with 32 million viewers.[1 </p>

                       <h1>HISTORY OF IPL</h1>
                       <p>n 2007, Zee Entertainment Enterprises founded the Indian Cricket League (ICL).[21] The ICL was not recognized by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) or the International Cricket Council (ICC). Moreover, the BCCI was unhappy about its committee members joining the ICL executive board.[22] In response, the BCCI increased the prize money for its domestic tournaments and imposed lifetime bans on players who joined the rival league, which it considered a rebel league.[23][24]

                        Foundation
                        On 13 September 2007,[25] following India's victory at the 2007 T20 World Cup,[26] the BCCI announced a franchise based Twenty20 cricket competition known as the Indian Premier League. The inaugural season was scheduled to start in April 2008, commencing with a "high-profile ceremony" in New Delhi. BCCI Vice-President Lalit Modi, who led the IPL initiative, provided details of the tournament, including its format, prize money, franchise revenue system, and squad composition rules. The league, to be managed by a seven-man governing council, would also serve as the qualifying mechanism for that year's Champions League Twenty20.[25]</p>
